| **Sharding**           | 4 shards, transactions within the same shard and between different shards are supported<br/> higher transaction fee for cross-shard transaction                                  |
| **Smart Contracts**    | smart contracts are supported within the same shard                                          |
| **Seele Wallet**       | easy-to-use wallet                                                                             |
| **High TPS**           | same shard TPS: 500/shard, cross shard TPS: 12/shard                                           |
| **Auditable Supply**   | total supply: 1,000,000,000 SEELEs, 300,000,000 SEELEs for mining                              |

The official Golang implementation of Seele. Seele is an open source blockchain project which consists of advanced sharding technology and the innovative anti-asic MPoW consensus algorithm. [https://seele.pro](https://seele.pro)

The current mainnet release: Seele mainchain is powered by a new anti-ASIC consensus PoW algorithm, which requires scientific calculation related to matrix. [MPOW PAPER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04565) The mainchain has four shards. It can perform transactions within a shard or crossing shards. However, smart contracts currently can be only executed within the same shard. Seele subchains are under development. [Seele Stem subchain protocol](https://medium.com/@SeeleTech/seele-stem-subchain-protocol-b5eceb02aaa3). The so called EDA consensus algorithm [EDA PAPER](http://seele.hk.ufileos.com/Seele_Yellow_Paper_EDA_A_Parallel_Data_Sorting_Mechanism_for_Distributed_Information_Processing_System_Pre-Release.pdf) from Seele will be utilized for the subchains.

# Download (without building)
If you want to directly run the node and use client without setting up the compiling enviroment and building the executable files, you can choose right version to download and run:

| Operation System |      Download Link     |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Linux   | [https://github.com/seeleteam/go-seele/releases]|
| MacOs   | [https://github.com/seeleteam/go-seele/releases]|
| Windows | [https://github.com/seeleteam/go-seele/releases]|

# Or Download & Build the source

Building the Seele project requires both a Go (version 1.7 or later) compiler and a C compiler. You can install them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

- Building the Seele project requires both a Go (version 1.7 or later) compiler and a C compiler. Install Go v1.10 or higher, Git, and the C compiler.

- Clone the go-seele repository to the GOPATH directory:

```
go get -u -v github.com/seeleteam/go-seele/...
```

- Once successfully cloned source code:

```
cd GOPATH/src/github.com/seeleteam/go-seele/
```

- Linux & Mac

```
make all
```

- Windows

```
buildall.bat
```
